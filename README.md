### **Run it locally, but also I am hosting it on Heroku**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jjquaratiello/DalibookBackend.git
cd DaliBookBackend
npm install
node app.js
```
Also you will need to change the VITE_API_BASE_URL var in .env. I commented it their, but base behavior it to heroku hosted API. Will be running on PORT 5000 locally
